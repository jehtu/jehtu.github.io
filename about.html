<h2>Data Visualization</h2>
    
<h4>My data visualization follows the interactive slideshow narrative structure. To achieve this, I picked one pollutant, Nitrogen Dioxide, and used notes that I researched and annotations to conduct the storytelling. As I am no expert in environmental sciences, I did not make conclusions about my data or the research. I used the research to educate the reader, to pose thought-provoking questions, and point out data.</h4>
    
<h4>The interactive slideshow contains 17 scenes in all, with each scene representing the average Nitrogen Dioxide levels among US states in a year from 2000 to 2016. This was a good slide ordering because as the user progresses through the visualization, he/she learns about the nature of Nitrogen and Nitrate pollution and will be prompted to think about how the data is changing by year.</h4>
    
<h4>Initially, I believed my interactive slideshow needed to be more story-driven. But although my storytelling isn't detailed with interpolations and calculations, it's easy to visualize. I could also use storytelling with annotations.</h4>
    
<h4>To perform the highlighting functionalities of annotations I color coded relevant information elements with blue. If a term was color coded blue in the summary, it meant that it corresponded to state regions in the choloropleth. The reader was encouraged to hover over regions of interest. One example were the participating states in the Clean Air Act. It was interesting to see the change that happened between 2005-2012 due to the efforts of the government to combat pollution. Annotations always follow the same template.</h4>
    
<h4>The main parameter of my entire data visualization is the year. The year determines the state of the visualization because you can get completely new data and annotations. Another parameter I used was the state (region) in the hybrid pie/bar chart. This last slide may seem unrelated which makes sense because it was originally intended to be a Martini Glass. However, the data it uses is correlates with the rest of the visualization.</h4>
    
<h4>My pie/bar chart uses a drop-down menu trigger to select the state. My pie/bar chart displays the ratio of years for each state. My slideshow back and next hyperlinks are technically triggers that trigger the parameter change of year.</h4>
    
<h4>Another detail I'd like to mention is the use of path and projections. I do think these were parameters as well and I used them to fill the chloropleth and set up the tooltip.</h4>
